        <p>
            Some time ago, I decided to venture into the creation of web pages using templates that I discovered in the vast world of the Internet. Without realizing it, I found myself immersed in the exciting universe of coding and web development. Currently, I am proud to share that <span className="text-white font-bold">I have participated in several projects</span> that have brought more than a smile to my clients' faces.
        </p>
        <p>
            My main focus is the creation of <span className="text-white font-bold">dynamic and modern websites</span>. Although I specialize in <span className="text-white font-bold text-lg">Front End</span>, my skills in  <span className="text-white font-bold text-lg">Back End</span> and  <span className="text-white font-bold text-lg">Database Administration</span> are not far behind, which allows me to consider myself a <span className="text-white font-bold text-lg">Full Stack</span> enthusiast.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am proficient in some web development technologies such as <span className="text-white font-bold text-lg">HTML</span> and <span className="text-white font-bold text-lg">CSS</span> (the basics) and <span className="text-white font-bold text-lg">JavaScript</span>. We can add to this a number of frameworks and libraries like<span className="text-white font-bold text-lg">Vue</span> and <span className="text-white font-bold text-lg">React</span>. On the server side I could mention <span className="text-white font-bold text-lg">PHP</span> and <span className="text-white font-bold text-lg">Node.js</span>, a bit of <span className="text-white font-bold">Python</span> and <span className="text-white font-bold">Java</span> but they are not my favorites; although, it is indisputable that I love to write code using <span className="text-white font-bold text-lg">Laravel</span>, <span className="text-white font-bold text-lg">CodeIgnither</span> or <span className="text-white font-bold text-lg">Express</span> especially when I combine it with <span className="text-white font-bold text-lg">SQL</span>, usually with MySQL and PHPMyAdmin.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not in front of a screen, I usually enjoy music, playing chess, going out for a motorcycle ride or sharing <span className="text-white font-bold">special moments with my daughter</span>, who always surprises me with her funniest occurrences.
